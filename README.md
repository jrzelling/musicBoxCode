The breadboard and wires shown are sending a signal to the Makey Makey, which is outside of the camera range in the video. The color wires are alligator clips connected to the Makey Makey. 

The Makey Makey connects to a Macbook by USB. Javascript maps the A,S,D,F,G, etc keys to a musical note, 12 keys in all. Using the input from the keys, the Macbook plays individual sounds through its speakers. 

Any instruments sound can be substituted for the one I chose, but I like the eery harmonious tones. A piece of scrap copper is used for playing the wires. Code is in javascript.
